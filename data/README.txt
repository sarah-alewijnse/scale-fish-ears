DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
Otolith-derived field metabolic rates, reported as C_resp values; the proportion of metabolic carbon in a fishes blood (see Chung et al. 2019 Mar. Freshw. Res.), and otolith-derived experienced temperatures in degrees Celcius.
Also included are the δ13C and δ18O used to derive C_resp values and experienced temperature.

This dataset contains:
* species = the species' binomial scientific name
* spp_code = a three-letter species code, usually compiled of the first letter of the Genus, and the first two letters of the species
* c_resp_mean = the mean C_resp value estimated from δ13C of the otolith, using Bayesian methods
* c_resp_sd = the standard deviation of the C_resp value estimated from δ13C of the otolith, using Bayesian methods
* temp_mean = the mean experienced temperature (degrees Celcius) estimated from δ18O of the otolith, using Bayesian methods
* temp_sd = the standard deviation of experienced temperature, estimated from δ18O of the otolith, using Bayesian methods
* body mass = the body mass of the fish (wet weight) in grams
* oto_d13c_mean = the δ13C value of the otolith
* oto_d13c_sd = the uncertainty associated with oto_d13c_mean
* oto_d18o_mean = the δ18O value of the otolith
* oto_d18o_sd = the uncertainty associated with oto_d18o_mean
* dic_d13c_mean = the estimated δ13C value of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the ambient water
* dic_d13c_sd = the uncertainty associated with dic_d13c_mean
* diet_d13c_mean = the estimated δ13C value of the fish's diet
* diet_d13c_sd = the uncertainty associated with diet_d13c_mean
* water_d18o_mean = the estimated δ18O value of the ambient water
* water_d18o_sd = the uncertainty associated with water_d18o_sd
* year = the year in which the fish's otolith was collected
* lat = latitude of fish collection in decimal degrees (WGS84)
* long = longitude of fish collection in decimal degrees (WGS84)
* sample_type = whether the sample was taken from the otolith's outer surface (outer) or the whole otolith (whole)
* n = number of otoliths within the sample
* source = source institution of the otolith
	* SUMIE = Southampton University Marine Isotope Ecology Lab, University of Southampton
	* NHM = Natural History Museum London
	* Tristan = UK Government Blue Belt Program (Tristan da Cunha)
	* BAS = British Antarctic Survey
	* Ascencion = Ascencion Islands Government
	* IFREMER = Institut français de recherche pour l'exploitation de la mer
	* Taiwan = National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan
	* Cefas = Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science
	* Israel = Tel Aviv University, Israel
